Great food, nice staff and good service. The food is fresh and quality is consistent on every visit. Prices hike like crazy every year though. They sure have gained some popularity with the lack of competition in the Vietnamese food market, and are making the most of it. Be ready for a surprise price hike in the menu on your next visit.

The location is really lovely and we love the Gorkhali Chatpate thing over there. Also, the bacon shrimp are really good. Sometimes there might be issues with getting drinks and confusion with the waiters so make sure you keep track of your food or you might be overcharged or overserved.

Yala cafe is one of my favourite places to eat in Kathmandu and is very convenient when you're staying at the hotel Yala Peak. They even give you a 10% discount when you're in that case! The food is very good and rather cheap, and the staff is very friendly! I highly recommend this place :)
